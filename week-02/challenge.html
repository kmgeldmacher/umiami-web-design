    <h1>Challenge: Note Hunt</h1>

    <p>Somewhere in my home directory are your notes for today's lecture.</p>

    <p>They are stored in a folder <code>week-02</code>.</p>

    <p>You will have to walk me through typing in commands to:

    <ol>
      <li>Find the directory.</li>
      <li>Move the file to its correct location (<code>umiami-web-design</code>).</li> 
      <li>Commit the file to GitHub.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You have 10 minutes.</p>
