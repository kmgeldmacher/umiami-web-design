    <h1>Exercise: Apply a Style Sheet!</h1>

    <p>Remember all those questions you asked about making your pages <em>look good</em>? Now you have the tools to do so!</p>

    <p>Take the Presidential Election page you have been working on and apply an <em>external style sheet</em> to it. (Make sure you place your stylesheet in the <code>css</code> directory within your exercise's directory. Keep your files organized!)</p>

    <p>Try to change properties related to alignment, fonts, sizes, background colors (maybe even background images!), colors, borders, list styles, opacity, how an item displays (block, inline -- can you change that?) etc. <a href="http://bit.ly/1bDaau3">WebPlatform</a> has a comprehensive list of CSS properties -- there are 346 of them! -- and the values they accept.</p>

    <p>If you need to modify your HTML, that is okay.</p>

    <p>Go crazy! Well, kind of. Remember, this <em>is a design class</em>. Don't turn your page into a mess by committing design sins (i.e. poor font combinations, misaligned elements, poor color or background choices)!</p>

    <h2>Assignment for Wednesday</h2>

    <p>Come to class with several properties (and the values they accept) you learned about and what they do. Or perhaps you discovered something about the way CSS can be applied? (<em>Yes, that's kind of a hint.</em>)</p>

    <p>Here's the catch: Everyone has to present something different. No duplicate information. I will draw names at random. Anyone who cannot offer a unique property will have one half of the day's class participation points deducted from their final grade.</p>

    <h2>Important Note</h2>

    <p>I highly recommend avoiding properties that involve margins, padding, positioning, etc. These are related to the box model and layout, which we will go over in a couple weeks. These aspects of CSS can be tricky, so better not to confuse and frustrate yourself right now.</p>

    <h2>Tips for debugging CSS</h2>

    <p>The W3C has a <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validator</a>. If you find a style isn't applying as you might expect it to, run it through the validator to see if you have any syntax errors.</p>

    <p>If a property you have applied still does not do anything, it might be related to one of the areas I suggested you avoid. Or it may need another property set to work correctly.</p>
