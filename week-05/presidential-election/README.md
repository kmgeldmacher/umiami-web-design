We took our Presidential Election example and applied a basic style sheet.

This is by no means comprehensive or an indicator as to how *you* should style the page (that's a matter of creative and design tastes). But we wanted to demonstrate some things you can do with style sheets to enhance a page in terms of aesthetics and in improving the way information is presented.

A few examples of what we did:

- Applied a custom link color, as well as :hover and :active states. These are subtle changes, but give a user feedback as to how they are interacting with a page.

- Defined a style for the `abbr` element. The tag is great for describing abbreviations and acronyms, but default styling varies among browsers. We want our users to understand there's something special about this little bit of text, so we differentiate it from the rest of the content with subtle styling.

- We cleaned up our table to include a border and provided white space by defining a width for table headers (`th`) and table data cells (`td`). This makes it easier for our user to read. There are different properties we can apply here, but we'll introduce those with the "Box Model." 

- We added a background gradient to our list of "Top 5 States." The information speaks for itself, but how can we communicate that visually? Color change is one way to do so. In this case, the deeper the color, the more decisive the vote.
