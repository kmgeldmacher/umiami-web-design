    <h1>Project 1: Structure</h1>

    <h2>Due Date: Wednesday, February 19, 2014, 11:59 p.m.</h2>

    <h2>Points: 10</h2>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>Using valid HTML and best practices, create an HTML version of your r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</p>

    <p>You are welcome to be creative in how you present the r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but consider your information hierarchy.</p>

    <p>What aspects would you present to the employer if you knew they may only look at your r&eacute;sum&eacute; for 30 seconds? What do you want to stand out? Are you better providing a paragraph describing your experience or are lists more functional?</p> 

    <p>We have provided a sample r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but we suggest you explore different presentations. You may even want to consult with an on-campus career counselor or advisor in forumlating your r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</p>

    <p>In terms of meeting the requirements of creating a properly structured document, we will be looking for the following:

    <ul>
      <li>The document must validate using the <a href="http://validator.w3.org">W3C HTML Validator</a></li>
      <li>The document content should be structured with HTML5 tags (i.e. header, navigation, section, etc.)</li>
      <li>Headlines and subheads (h1-h6), should be used in proper order throughout the document</li>
      <li>The document should include navigation linking to each section of your site</li>
      <li>Include a minimum of one external link</li>
      <li>Images, such as a professional portrait, should be saved in the proper format and a reasonable file and image size</li>
      <li>Links or images should NOT break</li>
      <li>Use of any special characters should be properly encoded</li>
      <li>Use of correct style, spelling and grammar</li>
      <li>The document should conform to best practices specified in lecture and/or readings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One quarter of a point (0.25) will be deducted for each error.</p>

    <p>Create a repository in GitHub named <code>project-structure</code> and push your file to this directory. Email me with a link to this  GitHub repository by the noted deadline (<strong>Wednesday, February 19, 2014, 11:59 p.m.</strong>). Every day your project is late -- and this includes turning in your project at Feb. 20, 12:00 a.m. -- the points equivalent to one letter grade (2 points) will be deducted from your final score.</p>

    <p>We will create a pull request in GitHub with comments on your original file. Grades will be sent privately via email.</p>
